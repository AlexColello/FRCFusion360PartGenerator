Creating a custom profile:

1. Start by creating a file with the name of the profile you would like and the extension .json, for example "Test 1.json".
2. Copy the following into that file:

{
    "height": 0,
    "horizontalHoles": [
    ],
    "id": "",
    "objtype": "BoxTubeFrameProfile",
    "verticalHoles": [
    ],
    "wallThickness": 0,
    "width": 0
}

3. Replace the values in the new file with those of your profile. The attributes that should be changed are as follows:

	height: The overall height of the tube profile in cm.
	width: The overall width of the tube profile in cm.
	wallThickness: The width of the wall in cm.
	id: The name of your profile. It must be surrounded by " characters.

4. Next add hole profiles to the verticalHoles and horizontalHoles list. To do this copy the following into whichever list 
is appropriate. The horizontalHoles will will cut accross the profile, into the faces of that are 'height' wide, while the 
verticalHoles will will cut through the profile verticaly, into the faces of that are 'width' wide.

        {
            "diameter": 0,
            "edgeDistance": 0,
            "objtype": "HoleProfile",
            "offset": 0,
            "spacing": 0
        },

5. Modify the values of the hole profiles to what they need to be. The attributes that should be changed are as follows:

	diameter: The diameter of the holes in cm.
	edgeDistance: The distance from the top left corner of the hole profile in cm.
	offset: The offset from the start of the extrude in cm. If 0, the center point of the first hole is on the outside 
		edge of the profile.
	spacing: The distance between each of the centers of the holes in the pattern in cm.

6. Save the file. The next time the 'Box Tube' command is selected the new profile should show up on the list of possible profiles.
